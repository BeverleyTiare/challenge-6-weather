##Weather Dashboard

This project was on developing a Weather Dashboard that features HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that links to an external site to retrieve weather data for cities, across a 5-Day period. The application links to the following API: https://api.openweathermap.org. In addition, the application uses local storage to store any persistent data, to thus allow the user to save and track weather data and events.

##Usage

The application uses the API as above to access weather forecasts over a duration of 5 days. The user enters a city to name to access data and storage of data is also featured.

The different weather data that is accessible includes temperature, humidity and wind.

##Usage

To use the application, open the Weather Dashboard via index.HTML file in your browser to view the weather data .
